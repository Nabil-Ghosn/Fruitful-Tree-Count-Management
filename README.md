# 🍃 Fruitful Tree Count Management

AI-powered system for detecting and counting fruit trees from satellite imagery, with integrated farm management and change detection services.

---

## 📜 Overview

Developed as my 2023 graduation project, this system automates fruit tree detection and counting using **GeoDjango**, **RESTful APIs**, **Leaflet.js**, and **OpenCV**.
It improves agricultural efficiency, reduces costs compared to traditional methods, and provides actionable insights to boost national income.

🏆 **Achievements:**

- **88% grade** in graduation evaluation.
- **1st place** in the National Programming Competition.
- Recognized by the **National Authority for IT Services**, **Ministry of Communication & Technology**, and **Wafa Telecom Company**.
